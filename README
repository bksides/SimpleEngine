The project can be built by executing the buildit script in the main project directory.  If all goes well, this will create an OgreApp executable
which can then be run to see the app.

The camera can be controlled using the arrow keys; however, it cannot be rotated.  The balls will collide with the walls and with eachother.
Upon collision, they emit a noise that is loaded and played using SDL.
